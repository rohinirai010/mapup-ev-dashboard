* Performance Optimizations

1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading :
FilterPanel and ChartsGrid are loaded lazily with React.lazy + Suspense to reduce initial bundle size.

2. Memoization & Callbacks :
Used useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in filters, insights, and data processing.

3. Data Export Optimization :
CSV export handled efficiently with Blob & URL.createObjectURL to avoid memory leaks.

4. Auto-rotating Insights :
Lightweight interval-based rotating insights with clearInterval cleanup for performance safety.

5. Responsive Design :
Optimized layouts with Tailwind grid and flex utilities to avoid heavy CSS computations.

6. Theming Optimization :
Centralized theme constants (LIGHT_COLORS, DARK_COLORS, getThemeClasses) for consistent styling without redundant re-renders.
